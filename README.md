Surf the musical road among the moon, stars, and northern lights.

A side project built by two people in a few months to show off VR running
inside a webpage. Built with HTML, JavaScript, and A-Frame. Not meant to be an
official game nor commerical product. Moon Rider is meant to be an open source
resource for the web developer community to learn from, and to push forward the
open WebXR initiative.

Big thanks to @elliottate for helping out with this!

## Development

Have Node (< v12, recommended v11) and npm installed.

```
npm install
npm run start
```

Then head to `localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Remixing and Forking

Make this game your own! Some easy ways to mess around:

- To modify or add more color palettes, change `src/constants/colors.js`.
- To change images, replace images in `src/assets/img/` folder. For example,
  replace the moon at `src/assets/img/moon.png'.
- To change models, replace models in `src/assets/models/` folder. For example,
  replace the arrow blocks at `src/assets/models/arrowblue.obj` or
  `arrowred.obj`.
- To change sounds, replace sounds in `src/assets/sounds`. For example, replace
  the hit sounds at `src/assets/sounds/`.
- Change various values such as `speed` in `src/state/index.js` or
  `BEAT_PRELOAD_TIME` in `src/components/beat-generator.js` to mess with how
  fast you travel along the curve, or how much reaction time until the notes
  arrive to the player.

Other ways such as adding more modes are more involved, but with knowledge of
A-Frame and JavaScript, is doable!
